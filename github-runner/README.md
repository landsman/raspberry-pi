# Self-hosted GitHub runner

Ephemeral GitHub Actions self-hosted runner for Raspberry Pi 5 (ARM64).

Each job spawns a fresh `custom-runner-nodejs` container that registers with GitHub, runs the job, and exits. 
**No runner software is installed on the Pi itself — only Docker is required**.

## What's inside the image

- [`myoung34/github-runner`](https://github.com/myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner) — base runner image with ARM64 support
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 22 — for `npx` / Sentry CLI
- [Deno](https://deno.land) for Deno tasks
- [Supabase CLI](https://github.com/supabase/cli) — latest ARM64 binary
- `postgresql-client` — `psql` for Supabase Vault secret upserts in CI
- `shellcheck` — shell script linter for `make qa` (dashboard deploy scripts)

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 5 with Docker installed

## Setup

**1. Configure environment**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in REPO_URLs and GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Generate a **classic PAT** for `GITHUB_TOKEN` ([docs](https://github.com/myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner/wiki/Usage)):

1. Go to **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)**
2. Click **Generate new token**
3. Check `repo` and `workflow` scopes
4. Click **Generate token** and paste it into `.env`

> The container uses this PAT to call the GitHub API and generate a fresh runner registration token on every restart — so a long-lived PAT is required, not the short-lived token from the Actions runner UI.

**2. Build and run**

```bash
make build
make up
make logs
```

## GitHub workflow configuration

In any workflow you want to run on this runner, set:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, pi5]
```

## How it works

```
Pi (Docker only)
  └─ container starts
       └─ registers with GitHub as ephemeral runner
            └─ picks up one job → runs → deregisters → exits
  └─ Compose restarts the container → repeat
```

The `EPHEMERAL=true` env var tells the runner to deregister itself after a single job, ensuring a clean environment for every run.

## Watchdog (recover from stalled job pickup)

There's a [known upstream bug](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/1887) where ephemeral self-hosted runners stay listed as "Idle" on GitHub but stop receiving dispatched jobs. The only confirmed workaround is to restart the runner. This repo ships a watchdog that automates it.

**Components:**

- [`runner-ctl.sh`](./runner-ctl.sh) — queries the GitHub API and decides whether to cycle the runners
- `make cycle` — `down + up` without rebuild (faster than `make restart`)
- `make safe-restart` — cycles only if no runner is `busy=true`; safe to run unattended
- `make watchdog` — cycles only if the queue has runs older than `STALE_SECS` (default 120s) **and** no runner is busy

**Install crons** (Pi):

```bash
make cron-install
```

Installs all github-runner cron jobs in one shot:

- `15 6 * * *` → `make prune` — daily image prune (>48h unused)
- `30 */4 * * *` → `make safe-restart` — every 4h preventative cycle, skipped if a job is running
- `*/5 * * * *` → `make watchdog` — every 5 min, cycles only if a stale queue is detected

Logs go to `~/logs/docker/github-runner-watchdog.log`. Inspect cycle activity with `make watchdog-stats`. Logs are rotated weekly by `make -C ../docker cron-install`.

**Dependencies on the Pi:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y jq
```

`curl`, `flock`, and `make` are already present on standard Raspberry Pi OS.

**Tuning:** override `STALE_SECS` per invocation, e.g. `STALE_SECS=300 make watchdog`.

## Surviving `docker system prune`

Ephemeral runners briefly enter "stopped" state between jobs, so a raw `docker system prune` will sweep them mid-cycle. Both runner services carry the `preserve=true` label in `compose.yml`, which is honored by:

- The scheduled cleanup — `../docker/Makefile` `prune` target passes `--filter "label!=preserve=true"`
- Interactive shells — install [`../docker/docker-prune-guard.sh`](../docker/docker-prune-guard.sh) via `make -C ../docker guard-install` to wrap `docker system prune` / `docker container prune` with the same filter

Without one of these in place, ad-hoc prune commands will delete the runner containers.

## Scaling to multiple repositories

By default the runner is scoped to a single repository (`RUNNER_SCOPE=repo`). To cover additional repos you would need one Compose service per repository, each with its own `REPO_URL`.

The cleaner alternative is to create a free **GitHub Organization**, register the runner at org scope (`RUNNER_SCOPE=org`), and point all your repos there. A single service then handles jobs from every repo in the org — no duplication needed.

```yaml
# org-level example
environment:
  RUNNER_SCOPE: org
  ORG_NAME: your-github-org   # instead of REPO_URL
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}  # needs org admin scope
  LABELS: self-hosted,pi5
  EPHEMERAL: "true"
```
