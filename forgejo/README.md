# Forgejo application

Self-hosted Git service running in Docker on Raspberry Pi.

- Source: https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo
- MCP server: https://codeberg.org/goern/forgejo-mcp
- iOS app: https://codeberg.org/secana/Forji
- Android app: https://codeberg.org/gitnex/GitNex

## Configuration

Set the required env variable values before starting:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Usage

```bash
make up                                           # start
make down                                         # stop
make logs                                         # follow logs
make backup                                       # run backup manually
make restore FILE=forgejo-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz
make cron-install                                 # register daily backup cron job (fails if already exists, run: crontab -l | grep forgejo)
```

## Ports

- `3000` — web UI
- `222` — SSH (git over SSH)

## Backup

Backups are stored in `/home/containers/backup/forgejo` as `forgejo-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`.
The last 14 days are retained; older files are deleted automatically.

### Cron (daily at 3am)

```bash
make cron-install
```

## Runner

The Actions runner runs on a dedicated box — see [../forgejo-runner](../forgejo-runner).
Nothing runner-related lives here anymore.

Known Forgejo registry/package and Actions limitations: see
[forgejo-runner/CAVEATS.md](../forgejo-runner/CAVEATS.md).
